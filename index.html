      <p>    I had a rough childhood. I was passed back and forth between my mom and dad. I met the man who became the love of my life 
         at the age 16. We got married and had our first child at 18. 
        </p>
        <p>  The last couple of years have been the best the best years! As a family we traveled to Mexico twice! The first time we went 
         to Andy's home town Mexico City. The experience our children had was an experience of a lifetime! They were able to meet their 
         cousin for the first time and learn how their daddy grew up! they experienced real street food!

      <p id="testP">  When there is nothing but good something bad always happens. A year ago my mom was starting to lose he vision. what we had 
         thought to be an effect of her diabetes was actualy a tumor in her brain. 6 months ago she was diagnosed with the tumor putting 
         pressure on her optic nerve causing her vision loss. The good outcome was the tumor was benign. She went in for surgery on March 
         31st. When they tried to wake her up she was very drowsey and not coming to it mentally. For a week she was in wat we call lala 
         land, saying funny things and sometimes getting aggressive. On April 10th at 12:30 in the morning I recieved a phone call from 
         my sister with the worst news a daughter could get. On the phone, my sister barely able to talk, saying &quot; mom went into cardiac 
         arrest. The doctor was right next to her when it happened they were able to bring her back with 10 minutes of cpr &quot;, but we already 
         knew this was the end, they had to put her life support. A couple hours later, we packed up our car and headed down to Tennessee. 
         On April 11th she was pronounced brain dead.

      <p>  With everything that has happened in the last few months I have found the way to move on. Yes it still hurts me a lot everyday 
         but I am doing the best I can for my family and my children. My sisters are my world and some days I wish we were closer together
          and not miles apart. We are continuing to live with her in our minds! 
        </p>
   
        <p> Here's to what the future will bring!</p>
